## AWS/Azure Intro
AWS is one of the most popular cloud platforms. Knowledge in AWS and Azure will defintely help you out when coming across tickets as companies are moving towards cloud.

You should have been given access to AWS and Azure. If not, reach out and open a ticket with the [CORE TEAM](https://coreservices.red-gate.com/hc/en-gb). I believe **IT Ops** or **COREDev** can help provisioning access for you.

You can check out the AWS or Azure portal below (:bookmark:bookmark them!):

## Useful Certifications
:books: I recommend going after certifications as it will help provide you with the foundational knowledge to succeed. :books:

1. [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) - **Beginner**
2. [Azure Fundamentals AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) - **Beginner**
3. [AWS Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) - **Intermediate**
4. EXPLORE YOUR OWN CERTS! The ones mentioned above are certifications that I found useful. Keep in mind that there are a bunch of others certifications. For example, there are certifications for MS SQL Server and other cloud platforms or tools.

Notes: 
- I recommend that you use online resources, such as YouTube or Udemy.
- Once you've completed the course on YouTube or Udemy, you can use practice test banks to familiarize yourself with questions that will be asked.
