## Useful Certifications
I recommend going after certifications as it will help provide you with the foundational knowledge to succeed.

1. [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) - **Beginner**
2. [Azure Fundamentals AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) - **Beginner**
3. [AWS Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) - **Intermediate**
4. EXPLORE YOUR OWN CERTS! The ones mentioned above are certifications that I found useful. Keep in mind that there are a bunch of others certifications. For example, there are certifications for MS SQL Server and other cloud platforms or tools.

Notes: 
- I recommend that you use online resources, such as YouTube or Udemy.
- Once you've completed the course on YouTube or Udemy, you can use practice test banks to familiarize yourself with questions that will be asked.
