# Welcome to my Redgate Tools Notes

We have a lot of tools at Redgate so it might be overwhelming at first. I recommend to work with a single tool to get used to the type of tickets then move on to the next once you've hit a good comfort level.

Tools:
- SQL Monitor
- SQL Change Automation
- SQL Compare / Data Compare
- SQL Prompt
-
