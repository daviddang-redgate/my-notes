# Onboarding Notes
Hope this will help any new hires coming on with the role.

*Note: Please feel free to fork this page or clone it onto your Git repository. 

**I highly recommend to start taking notes on Github, this will improve your understanding of Git as a whole while being able to jot down some important stuff.***

## Onboard Checklist:
- [x] Welcome to Redgate! Hope you enjoyed your warm welcome from everyone!
- [ ] Check calendars for any events coming up
- [ ] Set up your test environment (or you can start with your local environment)
- [ ] Pick a tool to start learning (I highly recommend SQL Prompt)
- [ ] Go through Zendesk and familiarize yourself with the tickets and queue
- [ ] Reach out to team if you have any questions

## Sections
I've split the notes into two sections:
1. [Useful Info](https://github.com/daviddang-redgate/my-notes/blob/main/UsefulInfo.md#useful-info)
2. [Redgate Tools](https://github.com/daviddang-redgate/my-notes/blob/main/RedgateTools.md)
